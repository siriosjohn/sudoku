# sudoku

This is a simple C program to check, solve and generate sudoku Puzzles.
For solving a puzzle I used a backtracking algorithm.

Accpetable arguments:

'-c'
Waits for a puzzle input
from the command line and then checks it for errors. 

'-g nelts'
Generates a puzzle that has 'nelts' non-empty ellements.

Running the executable with no arguments expects input of a Sudoku
puzzle from the user and then solves it using a backtracking algorithm.


This was an assignment of a University class.
